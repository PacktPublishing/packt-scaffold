#About this Demo

This interactive application demo is available on Windows, OSX and Linux. It displays Packt content that has been packaged as a GitBook project inside native operating system wrappers. This MVP isn't the most exciting, it's mainly a functional proof of concept of offline-friendly courses that can be sold on application stores whilst providing us with user-tracking and control over UX.

The GitBook packages themselves can also be hosted on a normal web server, but that's the kind of thing we could probably charge extra for from specific businesses :).

Have a click around, and send an email to [erols@packtpub.com](mailto:erols@packtpub.com) with any feedback or bugs that you encounter (pretty please).

As a landing page, this bit would typically have a large cover image, complete with some credits of some kind. We could even embed some marketing content on here (dynamic link to DotD, email signup boxes, that kinda thing).
