# Content Examples

Most Packt material is *either* text or video. Existing 'blended' courses (React and Flask) were created by a manual process of assessing what we have, pulling it together, reading appropriate sections, editorially 'stitching' things together and assembling the final content into a static package.

Two examples here demonstrate slightly different things. The first is a Packt video with accompanying text above and code below. The latter uses animated images to save on word count, and demonstrate visual concepts in a more engaging way without needing the user to go through a full-fledged video.
