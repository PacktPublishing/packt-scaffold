# What Can Hydrogen Do?

This section details some of the content-level support that Hydrogen can work with out-of-the-box without any major compatibility problems. The key points are text, video and code.

As well as the navigation bar on the right, inline navigation also works pretty well (if you want to skip ahead past the boring typography stuff):

* [Typography](typography.md)
* [Video Segments](video-segments.md)
* [Code Snippets](code-snippets.md)

It's likely that if we continue to develop this application wrapper, that we would check for online connectivity (probably to a Packt-owned server) and then gracefully degrade online-only features to offline equivalents. As it stands, everything you see within this application **works offline**. The focus of this demo is on transactional-type purchases where you have to download and run something locally (like existing video packages and courses).
