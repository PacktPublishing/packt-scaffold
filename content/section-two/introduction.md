# Client Support

There are some things that we can do that are enabled by moving to an offline client. It's not just a better experience (packaged up as a single executable) - it also affords us more control. Within an application wrapper we don't have to worry about interference with usage tracking, and we can still benefit from web-based technologies to include features like full-text search.
